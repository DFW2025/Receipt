Preheat the oven to 160 C fan oven
Mix flax and water set aside to make your flax egg
Melt choc over bain marie
Into a bowl sieve the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt and mix together
Melt the coconut oil in a saucepan and add to the flour mix along with the soaked flax seeds, vanilla extract and the non dairy milk. Beat very well by hand or with an electric hand mixer
Add melted choc, beat again for 2-3 minutes
Add to lined pan (we used a 30 x 20cm pan lined with parchment) and smooth top
Bake for 30-40 mins until a skewer inserted comes out almost clean
Remove from the oven and leave until fully cool. By leaving it to fully cool this is when the brownie will firm up and develop its finished texture. This can often be one of the hardest parts of making a brownie but so essential is you want your brownie to firm up. Enjoy!
